# Formula-SAE-Data-Analysis

This is a repo dedicated for Formula SAE results' analysis, for anyone who may be interested.

Specifically, it's made up of the following files:
* FSAE_year_results - Folders containing the csv files of the competitors' results over every event of the given year. It is important to notice that the results gathered are filtered based on what I thought would be useful to analyze, e.g. acceleration event doesn't include tries or penalties, but the definitive time per run instead.
* Analyses - Folder containing the Jupyter notebooks with the varying degrees of analyses, so everyone is able to replicate the results without issue.

##### This repo is part of Road to the Race team efforts to participate in Formula SAE Michigan, any support to dive deeper into the analises or following through [social media](https://www.instagram.com/road2therace/) is always welcome
